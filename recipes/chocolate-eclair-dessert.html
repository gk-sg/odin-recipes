        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chocolate éclair dessert is a no-bake pudding dessert that's so quick and easy to make — everyone loves it. I always keep the ingredients on hand in case I need a quick dessert. It's best if it sits overnight before serving.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 individual packages graham crackers</li>
            <li>3 cups cold milk</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package prepared chocolate frosting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan with a single layer of graham crackers.</li>
            <li>Combine cold milk and pudding in a large bowl; whisk briskly for 2 minutes. Mix whipped topping into pudding mixture until combined. Spread 1/2 of the pudding mixture over graham cracker layer. Top with another layer of graham crackers. Cover with remaining pudding. Top with a final layer of graham crackers.</li>
            <li>Frost top with chocolate frosting. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving to allow graham crackers to soften.</li>
        </ol>
