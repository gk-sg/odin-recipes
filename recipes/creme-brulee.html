        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crème brûlée is a lovely dessert to serve when entertaining. It's delicious served with either fresh mangos sprinkled with rum or strawberries with Grand Marnier or Cointreau.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks, 4 tablespoons white sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until thick and creamy; set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour cream into a saucepan and stir over low heat until it almost comes to a boil. Whisk cream into egg yolk mixture; beat until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into the top pan of a double boiler. Stir over simmering water until mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Pour into a shallow heat-proof dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set, about 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven to broil.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 2 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture evenly over custard. Place dish under the broiler until sugar melts and caramelizes, about 2 minutes. Watch carefully so as not to burn.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool slightly, then refrigerate until custard is set again, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
